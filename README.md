## 📰 **What is ItsFine?**

**ItsFine** is an AI-powered satirical RSS reader that takes the most alarming and dire news headlines and gives them a much-needed optimistic twist. Think of it as the superhero that swoops in to rescue your sanity from the clutches of sensationalism. Perfect for those moments when you need to remind yourself that everything is... *It's Fine*.

## 🌟 **Core Features**

### 1. **RSS Feed Handling**
- **Fetches Headlines on Launch:** No waiting around for updates. Get the first 10 headlines as soon as you open the app.
- **Built-in XML Parsing:** Zero third-party dependencies. Just good ol’ Foundation’s XMLParser doing its thing.
- **Stores Essentials:** Titles, Article URLs, and Publish Dates (because knowing when the end is near is still kinda useful).

### 2. **Headline Transformation**
- **Gesture-Activated Fun:** Simply shake your phone (or use another gesture if you're in the simulator) to transform the headlines into their more pleasant counterparts.
- **AI-Powered Optimization:** Thanks to OpenAI’s Chat Completions API, your headlines get progressively more optimistic and satirical with each shake.
- **Five Levels of Optimism:** From "More optimistic" to "Totally unhinged absolutely satirical level of optimism" – because why stop at just a little better?

### 3. **Animation & UI**
- **Glitchy Distortion Effects:** Watch your headlines go through an intense, super glitchy transformation before settling back to their now-trusted, non-alarming selves.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Despite the chaos, everything flows seamlessly. No awkward jumps, just pure, unadulterated smoothness.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Failures:** If things go south (like the RSS feed not loading or the API acting up), we’ll let you know without causing you any more stress. Plus, all errors are logged for debugging – because, obviously.

### 5. **API Key Security**
- **Secure Storage:** Your OpenAI API key is safely tucked away in a git-ignored `APIKeys.swift` file. Because your secrets should stay secret, unlike those depressing headlines.
