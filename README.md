### 2. **Headline Transformation**
- **Gesture-Activated:** Users can shake their phone to transform the current headlines into their optimized versions.
- **AI-Powered Optimization:** Uses OpenAI’s Chat Completions API to progressively enhance the headlines with each shake.
- **Five Levels of Optimism:** Transforms headlines through five distinct levels of optimism, ranging from "More optimistic" to "Totally unhinged absolutely satirical level of optimism."

### 3. **Animation & UI**

- **Smooth Transitions:** Ensures a seamless transition from distorted to clear text once the transformation is complete.
